    "# **Flight Delay Prediction using Scikit-Learn Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to build a **machine learning pipeline** using scikit-learn to predict flight delays. The pipeline integrates data preprocessing with model training, ensuring efficient handling of both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "- Preprocess numerical and categorical data using `ColumnTransformer`.\n",
    "- Automate the machine learning workflow using `Pipeline`.\n",
    "- Train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict flight delays.\n",
    "- Optimize the model using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Overview**\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Contains flight details such as:\n",
    "  - **Year**, **Month**, **Day**\n",
    "  - **Airline code**, **Origin airport code**, **Destination airport code**\n",
    "  - **Departure delay** (target: delayed or not)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable**:  \n",
    "  - `1` if the flight was delayed  \n",
    "  - `0` if the flight was on time\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Steps Involved**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**\n",
    "- Load the flight dataset and inspect its structure and missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- **Numerical Features**:\n",
    "  - `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`\n",
    "- **Categorical Features**:\n",
    "  - `AIRLINE__CODE`, `ORIGIN_AIRPORT_CODE`, `DESTINATION_AIRPORT_CODE`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer`**\n",
    "- **Numerical Data**:\n",
    "  - Impute missing values with the **mean**.\n",
    "  - Standardize values using **`StandardScaler`**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Categorical Data**:\n",
    "  - Impute missing values with `'missing'`.\n",
    "  - Encode using **`OneHotEncoder`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Pipeline Setup**\n",
    "- Use a **scikit-learn Pipeline** to link preprocessing and model training.\n",
    "- Integrate a **Random Forest Classifier** within the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Model Training and Evaluation**\n",
    "- Split the data into **train (70%)** and **test (30%)** sets.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model using a **classification report** with metrics like:\n",
    "  - **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV**\n",
    "- Tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest model:\n",
    "  - Number of estimators (`n_estimators`)\n",
    "  - Maximum tree depth (`max_depth`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Model Persistence**\n",
    "- Save the trained model using **`joblib`** for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Technologies Used**\n",
    "- **Python**: Programming language\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning\n",
    "- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning, preprocessing, and model evaluation\n",
    "- **Joblib**: Model persistence\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Expected Output**\n",
    "- A **trained Random Forest model** to predict flight delays.\n",
    "- **Performance metrics** (accuracy, precision, recall) from the classification report.\n",
    "- A **saved model** (`flight_delay_classifier.pkl`) for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to create an automated **machine learning workflow** using scikit-learn’s `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`. The streamlined preprocessing ensures consistency during both training and testing. With **hyperparameter tuning**, the model's performance is further optimized, making it reliable for real-world flight delay predictions.\n"
